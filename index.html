<a name="Features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>
<h5>Store and retrieve data on most blockchains</h5>
<p>Apertus empowers people to publish creative works on indelible global platforms. We believe everyone should have the power to immutably archive their history and creations on the blockchains.</p>
<p>Apertus can immutably archive data on a blockchain. You can later recover the blockpage by entering a single transaction id; the root id.  Wallets must support the standard RPC calls orginally introduced by Bitcoin developers, most currently do.</p>
<h5>Monitor one or more blockchains in realtime</h5>
<p>Apertus converts any compatible blockchain into a publishing hub. Check the "Monitor Blockchains" box on the explore tab, sit back and watch as all data archived by other Apertus users is displayed in the monitoring window.</p>
<h5>Create an Apertus Profile - sign and verify archives</h5>
<p>Using a signature after creating an Apertus Profile proves the archivist owns the signature, and that the data returned to the client matches the data archived by the signee. It does this by creating a SHA256 hash of the entire archive. The hash is passed in as a message to the wallets signing function to create a signature. The signature is then attached to the archive for verification by other clients. Using a signature allows Apertus users to trust, follow and find archives. </p>
<h5>Proof</h5>
<p>Apertus uses a handy tool that creates a SHA256 hash of any file. This hash can then be archived on ANY Apertus compatible blockchain. The transaction ID generated during the archive process can later be used to retrieve the hash proving the file existed at the time of the archive. When used in conjunction with a profile (basic token) and a signature, the Proof feature can anchor a point in time using a hash of your work on a blockchain of your choice.</p>
<h5>Filter unsafe extensions</h4>
<p>By default, executable files and all web scripting is either filtered or cleansed. Trusting signatures will open this up, or by unchecking the Filter box. Never open executable files from an unverified source.</p>
<h5>New to Apertus 0.3.X</h4>
<p>Authenticated publishing on indelible, long-lived platforms is our primary thrust, however, social-media capabilities is a side-effect. Profile creation lends to social media features as each published items can be used like a news feed. The new Profile feature is streamlining this output as it constitutes a simple blockchain entity; a basic token. Apertus also now has #hashtagging, linking, and public & encrypted messaging. Apertus PGP web of trust applications warrant exploration. Apertus 0.4.0 will include updated token capabilities.</p>


<h2>
<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>
Note: Apertus is shaping up to be a great publishing tool - but use with caution - Apertus is experimental software - it's NOT wise to have large amounts of valuable cryptocoin in your Apertus-linked wallets - nor be depedent on your private keys for publishing. Backup, and be smart.
<h5>Install the client</h5>
<p>Click the link at the top of this page to download the offical Apertus client. Create a folder on your workstation and unzip the contents of the download into it.<br>
<h5>Upgrade the client</h5>
<p>Click the link at the top of this page to download the offical Apertus client. unzip the file into the Apertus folder on your workstation. When prompted to copy or replace files click Replace. Done!<br>
More detailed instructions can be found by running Apertus (no blockchain needed for this), then clicking help \ info, or click <a href="Info.html">here</a> for the most current help page. Below is a quick help guide.</p>
<h5>Install a wallet</h5>
<p>Apertus requires a full wallet to function. Depending on your CPU, Bitcoin & Litecoin can take days to synchronize, but the rest are quicker.  Bitcoin Testnet is quick, and it's easy to get coin. (see <a href="Info.html">detailed instructions</a> for more info).<br>
Here are a few of our favourites:<br>

<br>
<h5>Enable wallet RPC access</h5>
<p>To enable RPC, create a [CoinName].conf file using notepad, then place it in the Roaming App Data file associated with your wallet.<br>
<br>Example: C:\Users\[Your user name]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf
<br>Example: C:\Users\[Your user name]\AppData\Roaming\Litecoin\litecoin.conf<br>
<br>You may need to enable the viewing of hidden folders and files to see the AppData Folder.
<br>Paste the following three lines into your [CoinName].conf file and restart the corresponding wallet. Be sure to change the "...CHANGE-ME" credentials to something other than this example :)

<pre><code>server=1
rpcuser=RPC_USER_CHANGE_ME
rpcpassword=RPC_PASSWORD_CHANGE_ME
</code></pre>
</p>

<h5>Configure Apertus to use your wallets</h5>
<p>Now that you have enabled RPC on your wallet you need to configure Apertus to talk to the wallet.  Open Apertus by browsing to the folder you created and running the Apertus.exe program.
<br>Click on Settings \ Wallet.
<br>We pre-loaded the settings for several common wallets for you.
<br>Select the wallet you would like to begin using.
<br>Change the login and password to match the credentials you entered in the [CoinName].conf file.
<br>Check the Enable Wallet box.
<br>Click the Save Button.
<br>Note: Alter settings only if you really know what your doing - or are experimenting - see detailed instructions for more info.</p>

<a name="start-archiving-and-exploring" class="anchor" href="#start-archiving-and-exploring"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Start Archiving and Exploring</h2>
<p>Apertus is a blockchain reader/writer that currently uses non-redeemable destination addresses as a free-form 20-byte field to immutably store data onto a blockchain. The data is referenced and retrieved by Apertus using the final transaction id of the process; the root id.
Coins used are forever burned into the blockchain in a process we call "etching." It may take hundreds, or even thousands, of micro-transactions to archive your data depending on the cryptocurrency you are using and the amount of data you are archiving. Coins used in the archive process cannot be recovered, and once archived, the data cannot be altered in any way.  Make sure you have triple checked your data for errors before archiving.<br>

<h5>Archiving</h5>
After choosing your wallet and account, enter your data into the Enter Your Message Here box.<br> 
Hit Save - you just etched.
<h5>Exploring</h5>
Below are a few sample archives of blockpages. Copy and paste these root transaction id's into the Apertus search box and hit enter to restore the archives.<br>Note: Apertus must be connected to the blockchain listed for this to work.<br>
