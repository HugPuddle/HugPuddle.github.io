<a name="Features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>
<h5>Store and retrieve data on most blockchains</h5>
<p>Use Apertus - Disk Drive (ADD) along with your favorite crypto currency wallets to immutably archive UTF8 text messages, binary files or both!  ADD's open source ledger system allows you to store 1 or more files of any size on most blockchains.  You can later recover the files by entering a single transaction id.  Wallets must support the standard RPC calls orginally introduced by bitcoin developers. (Most currently do)</p>
<h5>Monitor 1 or more blockchains in "realtime"</h5>
<p>ADD converts any compatible blockchain into a media \ messaging hub. Just check the "Monitor Block Chains" box on the explore tab, sit back and watch as all data archived by other ADD users is displayed in the monitoring window.</p>
<h5>Sign and verify archives</h5>
<p>Signing an archive proves the archivist owns the signing address and that the data returned to the client matches the data archived by the signee. It does this by creating a SHA256 HASH of the entire archive. The HASH is passed in as a message to the wallets signing function to create a signature. The signature and signing address is then attached to the archive for verification by other clients. Signing your archives allows Apertus users to trust, follow and find archives.</p>
<h5>Proof of existence</h5>
<p>We added a handy tool that Creates a SHA256 hash of any file. This hash can then be archived on any compatible blockchain as UTF8 text. The transaction Id generated during the archive process can later be used to retrieve the hash Proving the file existed at the time of the archive.  To use this feature click File\Insert\Proof from the main menu.</p>
<h5>Filter unsafe extensions</h4>
<p>By default executable files and all web scripting is either filtered or cleansed. Never open executable files from an unverified source!</p>

<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>
<h5>Install the Client</h5>
<p>Click the link at the top of this page to download the Offical Apertus - Disk Drive Client. Create a folder on your workstation and unzip the contents of the download into it. You're done!</p>
<h5>Install a Wallet</h5>
<p>ADD requires a full RPC enabled Wallet to function. Some clients can take days to synchronize so be patient!  Here are a few of our favourites:<br>
<br><img height=40 src="images\bitcoin_logo_plain.png"> <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/download">Full Bitcoin Wallet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height=40 src="images\litecoin_logo_plain.png"> <a href="http://litecoin.org/">Full Litecoin Wallet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height=40 src="images\dogecoin_logo_plain.png"> <a href="http://dogecoin.com/getting-started/#desktop-wallet">Full Dogecoin Wallet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<h5>Enable Wallet RPC Access</h5>
<p>To enable RPC create a  [CoinName].conf file using notepad  and place it in the Roaming App Data file associated with your wallet.<br>
<br>Example: C:\Users\[Your user name]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf
<br>Example: C:\Users\[Your user name]\AppData\Roaming\Litecoin\litecoin.conf<br>
<br>You may need to enable the viewing of hidden folders and files to see the AppData Folder
<br>Paste the following three lines into your [CoinName].conf file and restart the corresponding wallet. Be sure to change the credentials to something other than this example!

<pre><code>server=1
rpcuser=RPC_USER_CHANGE_ME
rpcpassword=RPC_PASSWORD_CHANGE_ME
</code></pre>
</p>

<h5>Configure ADD to use your wallets</h5>
<p>Now that you have enabled RPC on your wallet you need to configure ADD to talk to the wallet.  Open ADD by browsing to the folder you created and running the ADD.exe program.
<br>Click on Settings \ Wallet.<br>

<br>Look we pre-loaded the settings for several common wallets for you!!<br>
  
<br>Select the wallet you would like to begin using.
<br>Change the login and password to match the credentials you entered in the [CoinName].conf file.
<br>Check the Enable Wallet box
<br>Click the Save Button.
<br>NOTE: Do not alter any other settings unless you really know what your doing..</p>

<a name="start-archiving-and-exploring" class="anchor" href="#start-archiving-and-exploring"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Start Archiving and Exploring!</h2>
<p>ADD Archives data by permanently moving small units of crypto currency to specialy encoded addresses that store portions of the data you are archiving inside. A unique transaction ID allows the complete archive to be reasembled later. it may take hundredes or even thousands of micro transactions to archive your data depending on the Cyrpto Currency you are using and the amount of data you are archiving. Coins used in the archive process cannot be recovered and once archived the data cannot be altered in any way.  Make sure you have triple checked your data for errors before archiving.<br>
<br>Below are a few sample archives.  Copy and paste these transaction Ids into ADD's explore Search box and hit enter to restore the archives.<br>NOTE: ADD must be connected to the blockchains listed for this to work.<br>
